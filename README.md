# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This weekâ€™s project was to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo. 

## The problem

First of all I grouped the elements into arrays and made objects of them, adding keys and values. I console.logged information about the object to see that it worked. 

Next step was to understand the code in javascript and connect this to the DOM. This was the difficult part and I struggled a lot. After some work I managed to understand how it worked and I'm particularly proud of the text that turns into black when Mrs WHites card is picked.

Next step was to add some styling and finally to make it responsive.
