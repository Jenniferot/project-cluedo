# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This weekâ€™s project was to create a piece of the classic board game Cluedo. 

## The problem

First of all I grouped the elements into arrays and made objects of them, adding keys and values. 

Next step was to understand the code in javascript and connect this to the DOM. This was the tricky part and I struggled a lot. After some work I managed to understand how it worked and I'm particularly proud of the text that turns into black when Mrs Whites white card is picked.

Next step was to add some styling and make it responsive.
