# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This project was to recreate parts of the classic board game Cluedo. 

## The problem

Parts og the code was already written when the assignment started. The task was to understand the code in javascript, add additional code, and connect this to the DOM. First of all I grouped the elements into arrays and made objects of them, adding keys and values. 

This was the tricky part was the functionality with Javascript. After some work I managed to understand how it worked and I'm particularly proud of the text that turns into black when Mrs Whites white card is picked.

Next step was to add some styling and make it responsive.
